# Automated Literature Review Generator

An all-in-one tool that transforms your collection of research paper PDFs into a polished, structured literature review. This project leverages advanced text extraction, automated summarization, and bibliographic metadata retrieval to help you quickly generate professional literature review entries complete with citations and a comprehensive bibliography.

> **Note:** This tool uses the Gemini API for text summarization and the CrossRef API for DOI metadata lookup. Ensure you have valid API keys and comply with their usage policies.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:**  
  Uses [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) to extract text from PDFs, processing up to a configurable number of pages per document.

- **Automated Summarization:**  
  Utilizes the Gemini API to generate concise, unique summaries of each paper. Each summary is enhanced with varied introductory phrases for a natural flow.

- **Bibliographic Metadata Retrieval:**  
  Automatically extracts DOIs from PDF texts and fetches corresponding metadata from the CrossRef API. Falls back on filename parsing (e.g., `Smith_2020.pdf`) if no DOI is found.

- **Multiple Citation Styles:**  
  Supports APA, MLA, and IEEE citation formats for both in-text citations and bibliography entries.

- **Concurrent Processing:**  
  Processes multiple PDFs concurrently using Pythonâ€™s `concurrent.futures`, speeding up the literature review generation.

- **Structured Final Output:**  
  Produces a complete literature review document with a header, numbered literature review entries, and a bibliography section. The final document is saved as `full_literature_review.txt`.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Implements retries with exponential backoff for API calls and logs errors to `log.txt` for troubleshooting.
